# Car Dheko - Used Car Price Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the price of used cars based on various features like car model, year of manufacture, engine type, mileage, and more. Using machine learning algorithms, this model provides an estimate of the price of a used car, helping potential buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model development, and deployment of the predictive model using a Streamlit application.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, removes outliers, and transforms data to improve model performance.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzes car attributes like make, model, year, mileage, and other features to understand the data better.
- **Model Development**: Implements machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Linear Regression) to predict car prices.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
- **Streamlit App Deployment**: Deploys the model as a web application using Streamlit for easy user interaction.
